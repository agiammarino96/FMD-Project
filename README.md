# FMD-Project
Project of the course Functional Mechanical Design, Politecnico di Milano, academic year 2019/2020. Read FinalReport.pdf for the details of the project and for the solution implemented. This project aims in the design of a multi-stage cam mechanism for an automatic machine. During this project two main tools have been used: MatLab programming and MSC Adams (software for multibody dynamics simulation). 

The steps for the design are summarizes as follows:
1. Design of the motion laws involved in the mechanism using MatLab.
2. Design of the Cam profiles resulting taking as input the motion laws of the previous step using MatLab.
3. Creation of the 3D model of the mechanism on MSC Adams, importing the profiles of the two cams from MatLab.
4. Kinematic and Dynamic simulation on MSC Adams for testing the design.
5. Post-processing of the results obtained from simulation.

The MatLab scripts of this project have been used for steps 1 and 2 (folder: src/To do before model Adams/) and for step 5 (folder: src/To do after model Adams/).
